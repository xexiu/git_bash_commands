### <a name="jira"></a>Â Jira Tickets
> If your branch starts with: PRO-1234, GOL-1234, CUS-1234 or any other word followed by "-" then a number
> the commit/s made after will have the start name of the branch in
> order to be more specific when making commints for a ticket that you have in Jira.

For example:

```sh
$ git checkout -b "CUS-3242/mybranch"
```

> The commits made on that branch will have: "[CUS-3242] - my commit message".
